i've always wondered what markdown files were so good for ðŸ¤” other than updating some `README.md` files, 
i've never had to use them in my day job -- but it seems like so many people use markdown **all the time** so i had to see what all the hype was about.

creating this portfolio site was the first time i experienced the full capacity of markdown files.
