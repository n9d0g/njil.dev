  <p>
    The tag/username comes from a time when I was playing JackBox with my church friends many years ago. 
    For most of my life whenever creating usernames, I would shorten "Nate Dog" to "n8dog" - except this time,
    my finger slipped up and pressed the 9 instead of the 8 ðŸ¤¦ All of my friends laughed at me, but I stuck with
    it over time. Throughout the years, the 'o' changed into a '0', and there you have it!
